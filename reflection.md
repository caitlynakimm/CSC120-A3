- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Initially Java looks pretty scary and complex to me--there's a lot of new terminology that I have to get used to (ex. public static void, System.out.println()) and I am not used to having to think farther ahead before I code. I noticed there's a lot more to type to code the same output compared to Python, but I am curious to see how Java might be more suitable for different projects (ex. web and mobile games).
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
