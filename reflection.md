Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Caitlyn & Nazifa - We consulted each other (Nazifa and Caitlyn) and JJ Cham while working on this assignment.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    Caitlyn: I attended office hours on Thursday, February 13th from 10:50 am to 12 pm and TA hours on February 17 from 7 pm to 9 pm.

    Nazifa: I attended Ab's office hours on February 17 at 1:30 PM and TA hours from 7 - 9 PM. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Caitlyn: Initially Java looks pretty scary and complex to me--there's a lot of new terminology that I have to get used to (ex. public static void, System.out.println()) and I am not used to having to think farther ahead before I code. I noticed there's a lot more to type to code the same output compared to Python, but I am curious to see how Java might be more suitable for different projects (ex. web and mobile games).

    Nazifa: At first Java felt like a completely foreign language to me and to be honest it made my head hurt. The structure and syntax of java was so different I was extremely confused by it. It took me some time to grasp the concepts of class, attributes, constructor, and method since that is not how I coded in Python. However, when I am able to code something in java it makes me feel really good since I am putting in a lot more effort.  

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
    Nazifa: I can draw the conclusion that the loops and the ideas behind the codes such as pseudocode is similar between the two languages. The biggest difference is the syntax and object oriented vs procedural. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Nazifa: Setting up the while and for loops worked, the if-else statements didn't work at first since initially they were written in a more python way but once we converted the syntax so that java could understand what we meant it worked. Advice I would give someone taking this course in the future is to watch videos, review the lecture, and ensure that you understand the concepts of Java. Then through the textbooks and research you will slowly learn the syntax of Java but that takes time so don't stress yourself out.
